# Next Foundation
An administration UI for [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) apps to automate and make building pages, posts, and more easier for developers and users who wish to build their websites/blogs on the framework.

## To-Dos
- Design user interface.
- Design software architecture for building the app. Considering building as an NPM module to use with an existing Next.js app, but not sure if that would make things any easier. I'm thinking it'll be more like a wrapper that uses Next.js on the backend.
- Determine authentication architecture.

## Contribute
If you'd like to contribute to this project, see the list of [To-Dos](https://github.com/cjkoepke/next-foundation/labels/To-Do). Currently need to flush out design patterns and initial wireframes of the administration interface.
